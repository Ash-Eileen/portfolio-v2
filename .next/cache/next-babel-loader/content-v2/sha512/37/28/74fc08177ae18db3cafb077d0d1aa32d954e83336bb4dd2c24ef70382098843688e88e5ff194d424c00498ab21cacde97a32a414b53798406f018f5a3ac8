The brief was to\n            create a site with full CRUD functionality on any subject. I worked\n            with a partner and we decided to make a site where people could pin\n            locations of succulents for others to take clippings from. The live\n            site can be found{' '}\n\t\t\t\t\t<a\n\t\t\t\t\t\thref=\"https://caculocation.herokuapp.com/\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttarget=\"_blank\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\trel=\"noreferrer\"\n\t\t\t\t\t>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<u>here</u>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t</a>\n            . In the 2.5 days we were able to implement full CRUD functionality,\n            authentication and authorisation, and the integration of a map with\n            geocoding and geolocation using the Mapbox API. This was a lot of fun\n            and it was great to see how much we could accomplish after only two\n            weeks of working with Node and Express and one week working with\n            MongoDB.\n\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t),\n\t\t},\n\t];\n\treturn (\n\t\t<>\n\t\t\t{projects.map((project, i) => {\n\t\t\t\treturn (\n\t\t\t\t\t<section key={i}>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<Image src={`${project.imageSrc}`} alt={project.name} width={500}\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\theight={400} />\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<h3>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href={project.link}>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<i className={project.codeIcon}/>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t{project.name}\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<i className={project.platformIcon}/>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</h3>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>{project.description}</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t</section>\n\t\t\t\t);\n\t\t\t})}\n\t\t</>\n\t);\n};\n\nexport default DisplayProjects;\n"]},"metadata":{},"sourceType":"module"}
