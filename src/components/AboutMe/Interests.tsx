          Did I mention that I like video games? Did I <strong>also</strong>
          mention that I worked in a Martial Arts dojo?

          I'm a huge lover of games from JRPGs to MOBAs to MMOs. The one type of
          game you probably won't find me playing is an FPS. Why? I'm a terrible
          shot. I'm an equal opportunity gamer playing everything from console
          games to handheld to PC games.

          As a kid I was never very good at sports, until I found
					<strong>my</strong> sport. Karate. Since I was a teenager I trained in
          multiple styles of Martial Arts, earning my second dan blackbelt and
          also travelling internationally to compete in tournaments. I've
          trained in karate, kickboxing, jiu jitsu, taekwondo and MMA.

          You might also catch me hanging out on the weekend with a cat snuggled
          up to me knitting or doing crochet.
